# ML tek5

Repository of the Tek5 machine learning course at Epitech, year 2025-2026.

The first session starts: September 18th 2025

The second session starts: November 27th 2025

## Python environment

To manage your python environment, several solutions exist.

uv is more modern and should work faster than pip.

A requirements.txt is at the root of the repo.

### uv

This page contains instructions on managing a project
with uv and installing from requirements.txt.

<https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/projects/>

### pip

Classic python package manager.

<https://docs.python.org/dev/installing/index.html>
